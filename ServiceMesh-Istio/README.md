- ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `fault injection`
- ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `circuit breaking`


Istio does not require any change to your application code. Istio deploys a special sidecar proxy to each of your application's Pods. 


This proxy, based on the popular, open source Envoy,  intercepts communication between microservices and is configured and managed using Istio's control plane functionality.
